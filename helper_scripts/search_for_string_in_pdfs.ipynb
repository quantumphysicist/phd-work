    "Functions:\n",
    "- search_in_pdf(file_path, search_string, context=200): \n",
    "  Searches for a string in a single PDF file and prints the page number and a snippet of the text around the found string. \n",
    "  It accepts a file path to the PDF, the search string, and an optional 'context' parameter \n",
    "  that determines the length of the surrounding text snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- search_in_directory(search_string, directory=os.getcwd()): \n",
    "  Recursively searches for the string in all PDF files located in a specified directory and its subdirectories. \n",
    "  It takes the search string and an optional directory path, defaulting to the current working directory.\n",
